        <p class="lead mb-4">Education is something that I value more than anything else, since it's the one thing that stays with a person forever and no one can take away. I have always been engaged in learning more and having the opportunity to gain more knowledge through different experiences and courses offered to me. This opportunity that I have been able to learn from the most and have learned to value this type of field, is Accounting. The summer going into my Senior Year of High School, I was able to assist in an audit that was being given to El Prado Cleaning Service Inc. The office manager, which hired me every summer since the summer going into freshman year, asked me if I was willing to help her with an audit. It was here where I was able to gain knowledge on the number of employees, profit, and loss of profit. I had the benefit to engage and observe how audits are worked upon, as well as how payroll and billing affects this. I have been able to work as an intern at a business office, alongside an accountant, and see how entrepreneurship works, as well as how all the paperwork and documentation is filed. This is a crucial education experience since it provides an outlook as to how the business world operates. This event offered me the opportunity to work with a variety of staff members, while also learning about all the different aspects of accounting and opening a company. This internship has taught me responsibility, precision, and carefulness with all documents and paperwork that were being handled by me. Precision was necessary for every number that was being inputted. Most of all it taught me how to be responsible since I was responsible for getting there at 7:00 am and leaving at 3:00 pm, which was the same as the other employees. The ability of being held close to the same standards as the other employees demonstrated how I was going to be expected to act and behave in a professional career in the future. While interning at this company, I was able to get an insight into what itâ€™s like to run a company with multiple employees, while also handling the financial aspects of a company. Through this internship, I also got the opportunity to gain knowledge and learn from an accountant who had been in the industry for 30 plus years. Due to this, she became my mentor and advised me when it came to what I wanted to study in college and do for a living. This experienced showed me what the outside world expected of me in a professional manner, but also the skills they expected of me going into the job. The internship helped me to keep my day organized everyday. <br><br>
